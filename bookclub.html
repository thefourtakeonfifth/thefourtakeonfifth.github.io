		<h1>Welcome to Book Club!</h1>
		
		<h3>Book discussions are a great way for girls to engage with a novel and reflect on their own experiences. Discussions should take place in a calm, safe environment where everyone feels that their voices are heard. Anyone can host a book club! A school counselor can use The Four Take on Fifth to guide a discussion about emotions and conflict resolution. A Girl Scout leader can incorporate the book into a badge-earning activity. A group of friends can form a book club just to have fun!</h3>
		
		<h3>If your discussion goes off topic, that’s okay! It is good to explore and connect your own experiences to the book, no matter what form that may take. The only rules are to be kind, respectful, and keep an open mind.</h3>

		<h3>We have provided some questions and activities to start your discussion. The Four Take on Fifth contains a similar list of questions for you to use.</h3>

	</div>
	
	<h3>Book Discussion Questions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Staying home alone is a big responsibility. What other responsibilities have you taken on as you’ve gotten older?</li>
		<li>Sometimes the girls got jealous of each other. How well did they handle their feelings? How have you dealt with feelings like that?</li>
		<li>Meera lost her grandmother. Have you ever lost someone close to you, and what did you do to feel better?</li>
		<li>What is the best way that Lyn could have handled her situation with the bullies?</li>
		<li>Which do you think is more difficult: to move away to be left behind?</li>
		<li>Which girl in the story did you relate the most to and why?</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Writing and Drawing Activities</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Pick a character from the story who you would like to know more about. Try writing another chapter for her! You can continue her story into sixth grade, or you could go back in time and write about her life before the events of the book.</li>
		<li>If you were to add another character into the story, who would it be? Try creating your own character and think about how they would interact with the other girls. If you’re stuck, you can always base your new character off of yourself or one of your friends!</li>
		<li>Is there a scene you liked in the book that did not have an illustration? Draw it yourself!</li>
		<li>Design a new cover for The Four Take on Fifth. Think about elements such as color, spacing, and word placement. What drawing would best represent the book?</li>
		<li>Pick one of your favorite scenes from the book. Try recreating the scene as a comic. First, divide a piece of paper into comic panels. Next, draw the characters and what they are doing. Finally, add dialogue with speech bubbles.</li>
	</ul> <br>
